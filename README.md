## purpose 
just a cool project. 



i also need to stop being indecisive!...

## motivation 
<p>
    <sub><sup><i>whats even the difference between purpose and motivation anyways ? .. </i></sup></sub>
</p>
The initial motivation was that I was always indecisive and therefore would resort to the easiest choice â€“â€“ to scroll on my phone. I've been exposed to social media since long and it has taken my attention and energy away from the things that I actually want to try and matter. By having a easier decision-making method which allows me to complete a simple task, like some simple chores by default, I hope that my actions will snowball and lead me to take more conscious choices, eventually completing the tasks and being the person I want to be. 

## source(s)
i am basing it off of a [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/-FNm58Z9GHM?si=nab7WdWw4G7CO9vj). gotta love the internet! \
additionally, I modelled my toggle switch button off of [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/nCJtL_-kDGU?si=zHwsm9okZisIlyKR). 

## upcoming changes / ideas
_potential (!!!) ideas..._
- [x] option to remove a choice automatically once selected (ie when the wheel lands on the said option)
  - [ ] i probably want to re-design it tho 
- [ ] potentially re-create as an iOS widge on the lock screen or home page so I can access it on my phone
- [ ] generate specific color tones / themes (eg. just pastel tones, or to generate colors that are not similar to each other for the adjacent parts --- currently the colors are randomly generalted)
- [ ] build another version which it has two layers of wheels (category version), and make them spin in opposite directions
- [ ] have the person click & drag their cursor over the wheel to simulate an actual wheel spinning
- [ ] deploy it & actually host the website. currently it is just local host ðŸ˜‹
- [ ] move the textbox & toggle switch to the right of the wheel (just a better placement imo)
- [ ] make the text self-wrap

## timeline
- 05/20/2025: started & finished tutorial. came up with ideas to advance the project
- 05/21/2025: updated the readme properly. TIL (or re-learned) that i can just preview instead of committing to view my changes ðŸ˜­
- 05/23/2025: i wanted to work on this everyday but i kind of fell off. oops... i tried to add the automatically-removing-winner thing, but i barely have it working. check my commit on this day to see additional details & further steps
- 05/26/2025: wth it's been three days ??? anywho I finally created a toggle button. followed a tutorial, and then re-designed my own switches with a little bit of help. added the css to the main html file, and incorporated functionality. yippee!
