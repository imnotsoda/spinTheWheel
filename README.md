wheel spinning shenanigans

## purpose / motivation
just a cool project. i also need to stop being indecisive!... The initial motivation was that I was always indecisive and therefore resort to the easiest choice --- to scroll on my phone. I've been exposed to social media since long and it has taken my attention and energy away from the things that I actually want to try and matter. By having a easier decision-making method which allows me to complete a simple task, like some simple chores by default, I hope that my actions will snowball and lead me to take more conscious choices, eventually completing the tasks and being the person I want to be. 

## source
i am basing it off of a [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/-FNm58Z9GHM?si=nab7WdWw4G7CO9vj). gotta love the internet! 

## upcoming changes / ideas
_potential (!!!) ideas..._
- [ ] option to remove a choice automatically once selected (ie when the wheel lands on the said option)
- [ ] potentially re-create as an iOS widge on the lock screen or home page so I can access it on my phone
- [ ] generate specific color tones / themes (eg. just pastel tones, or to generate colors that are not similar to each other for the adjacent parts --- currently the colors are randomly generalted)
- [ ] build another version which it has two layers of wheels (category version), and make them spin in opposite directions
- [ ] have the person click & drag their cursor over the wheel to simulate an actual wheel spinning
